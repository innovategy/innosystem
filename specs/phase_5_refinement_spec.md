# Innovation Ecosystem Platform - Phase 5 Specification: Refinement, Testing & Documentation

## 1. Phase Goal

Harden the system through comprehensive testing, refined error handling, and logging. Develop API documentation and user/deployment guides. Prepare the codebase for initial deployment.

## 2. Phase Deliverables

*   Comprehensive unit tests for core logic, repositories, and utilities.
*   Integration tests covering API endpoints, database interactions, and basic queue/runner flow.
*   (Optional) Basic end-to-end tests simulating job submission and completion.
*   Refined error handling across the API and Runner, providing clear and consistent error responses/logs.
*   Improved structured logging (`tracing`) with appropriate spans and event levels.
*   Generated API documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger standards.
*   Detailed README file covering setup, configuration, running the application, and development guidelines.
*   Deployment considerations and basic deployment scripts/Dockerfile refinements.
*   Code cleanup, dependency updates, and potential performance optimizations based on testing.
*   Add stubs or basic structures/comments indicating where future multi-currency/multi-lingual support (Section 7 of main spec) would integrate.
*   **Functional Outcome:** A well-tested, documented, and robust version of the platform, ready for initial deployment or user acceptance testing.

## 3. Testing Strategy

*   **Unit Tests (`#[cfg(test)]`):**
    *   Focus on individual functions, modules, and logic units.
    *   Test repository methods with mock database connections or in-memory implementations (if feasible).
    *   Test parsing, validation, calculations (e.g., retry delay).
    *   Use crates like `rstest`, `mockall` where appropriate.
*   **Integration Tests (`tests/` directory):**
    *   Require live PostgreSQL and Redis instances (often managed via Docker Compose for testing).
    *   Test API endpoint behavior: valid requests, invalid requests, authentication, responses.
    *   Test the full flow: API -> DB -> Redis -> Runner -> DB status update -> Wallet update.
    *   Test interactions between components (e.g., runner registration, heartbeat tracking).
    *   Use test fixtures or setup/teardown logic to ensure clean state between tests.
*   **End-to-End Tests (Optional):**
    *   Use tools like `reqwest` or test harnesses to interact with the running API and observe side effects (DB state, logs).
    *   Simulate realistic user scenarios.

## 4. Error Handling & Logging Refinement

*   Define a consistent application-wide `Error` enum (e.g., using `thiserror`).
*   Map underlying errors (Diesel, Redis, Serde, IO) into specific application error variants.
*   Ensure API endpoints return appropriate HTTP status codes and potentially structured JSON error bodies.
*   Review all `unwrap()` / `expect()` calls and replace with proper error handling.
*   Enhance `tracing` usage:
    *   Add spans (`#[tracing::instrument]`) to key functions/API handlers for better context.
    *   Use appropriate log levels (error, warn, info, debug, trace).
    *   Log relevant context (e.g., job_id, customer_id) within spans.
    *   Configure `tracing_subscriber` for potentially different formats (e.g., JSON) or outputs (file, console).

## 5. API Documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)

*   Use a crate like `utoipa` or `aide` integrated with Axum.
*   Annotate API handler functions and data models (request/response bodies) with documentation macros.
*   Generate an OpenAPI specification file (`openapi.json` or `openapi.yaml`).
*   Optionally serve Swagger UI or Redoc documentation directly from the API (e.g., at `/docs`).

## 6. Project Documentation (README.md)

*   **Overview:** Brief description of the project and its purpose.
*   **Prerequisites:** List required tools (Rust, Docker, PostgreSQL, Redis, `diesel_cli`, etc.).
*   **Setup:** Step-by-step instructions for cloning, configuring (`.env`), database setup (`diesel setup`, `diesel migration run`), and building.
*   **Running the Application:** How to start the API server and the Runner process.
*   **Running Tests:** Commands for `cargo test` (unit & integration).
*   **API Usage:** Link to the generated API documentation, examples using `curl`.
*   **Configuration:** Details on environment variables (`DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`, etc.).
*   **Development:** Guidelines for contributing, code style, running linters (`cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy`).
*   **Deployment:** Basic notes or scripts for building release binaries/Docker images.

## 7. Code Cleanup & Optimization

*   Run `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` and address issues.
*   Review code for clarity, simplicity, and maintainability.
*   Remove unused code or dependencies.
*   Identify potential performance bottlenecks (e.g., excessive DB queries in loops) and address them if necessary.
*   Update dependencies (`cargo update`) and check for compatibility issues.

## 8. Future Extensibility Stubs

*   Identify key areas where multi-currency and multi-lingual support would impact:
    *   `Wallet` model/table: Add commented-out fields for `currency_code`, `exchange_rate_to_base`.
    *   `WalletTransaction`: Add commented-out `currency_code`.
    *   API responses involving currency: Add comments indicating future currency fields.
    *   Error messages / UI text placeholders: Add comments like `// TODO: i18n`. Add a placeholder `locales` directory.
*   This ensures future developers are aware of the planned extensions.
